# Form made with React and Formik

Created for a coding challenge under the following instructions:

- The first three fields must be required
- When clicking ´Submit´, an object with the structure {name:input.value, email: input.value, password: input.value, textarea: input.value} must be generated and it should be showm in a modal in JSON format
- The modal should only appear in case the three required fields are completed (Formik suggested for validation)
- The styling is free, but must respect the sobriety of the example provided
- Besides functionality, the atomicity of the code will be evaluated (short codes and well divided)
